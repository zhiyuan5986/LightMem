The mental timeline is a vague, unplaceable past (possibly childhood/Combray) that the narrator cannot fully retrieve.\n2. **Anchor:** The specific anchor is the visual composition of \"three trees\" that appear at the entrance to a shady avenue.\n3. **Synthesis:** The narrator sees three trees that feel intensely familiar, as if they belonged to a \"forgotten book\" of his childhood. He tries to mentally jump back to identify them, but fails. As the carriage moves away, the trees are personified as \"phantoms\" or friends waving their arms in despair, representing a dead past that the narrator has failed to resurrect or recognize.",

This specific color and shape acts as a link, instantly transporting his mind back to the hill of Golgotha in Sunrise, where he saw a similar red ribbon in the sky just before dinner.",

The cognitive displacement occurs within the interpretation of the painting, blurring the line between the city (land) and the marine element.\n2. **Anchor:** The church of Saint-Cricq (Criques-Bec).\n3. **Synthesis:** The church acts as the anchor because it appears to rise 'from the water like a shell' or foam. This visual presentation displaces the church from the category of 'land/city' to 'sea,' making it seem more a part of the marine environment than the boats themselves, thus dissolving the boundary between the two elements.",

The specific anchor is the 'apple blossom' branch he buys in that future timeline to place under his lamp, contrasting the barren tree of the present with the artificial preservation of the flower in the future.",

The 'gravity' or attraction between these planets is represented by the curiosity and social gazing of the diners looking at other tables, creating a system of celestial bodies held together by social observation.",

Charles displaces this by anchoring the moon to a specific social memory: Chateaubriand used to visit her father (James) and recite the *same* lines about the moon to every guest as a parlor trick.

In his drunken state, this anchor (the shadow of the past) 'recedes' or disappears.

Locate Internal: He cannot reconcile the visual reality (brimless hat, peeling nose) with the fixed mental image he retained from the party (Item 4779, 4780). Analyze Interaction: Incongruity & Irony; the conflict between the static internal image and dynamic external reality causes the failure. Synthesis: The narrator fails to physically recognize Albertine because his internal mind is holding onto a rigid, static 'memory image' of her from a previous setting; the discrepancy between this internal projection and the new external reality (her different clothes and complexion) creates a cognitive block that temporarily prevents recognition.",

Synthesis: Steven's physical act of avoidance is rationalized by an internal metaphor where the group of girls is perceived not as humans but as a natural force (a wave); his mind maps the social encounter onto a physical danger, triggering a 'survival' response to turn away before being 'submerged' by their presence.",

Analyze Interaction: Incongruity & Irony; the trivial physical act dominates the supposedly momentous social event. Synthesis: Steven's action of eating a tart—a trivial pleasure—dominates the moment because his internal processing of the event has stripped it of its anticipated significance; the 'event' of meeting his crush becomes internally flattened, leading to a behavioral incongruity where he prioritizes a pastry over the person he longed to meet.",

The mental displacement shifts from the narrator's artistic reverence to Charles's mundane social memory.\n2. **Anchor:** The Moon.\n3. **Synthesis:** The narrator uses the moon to anchor a recitation of Chateaubriand, seeing it as 'genius.' Charles displaces this by anchoring the moon to a specific social memory: Chateaubriand used to visit her father (James) and recite the *same* lines about the moon to every guest as a parlor trick. This shifts the moon from a symbol of high art to a prop in a repetitive social performance.",

In his drunken state, this anchor (the shadow of the past) 'recedes' or disappears.

The ship has physically passed the butterfly's position, but the butterfly 'seems confident' it will arrive first.

Analyze Interaction: The internal thought process explains the drive for the external action; the narrator values the work precisely because of this aesthetic ambiguity and the 'unfathomable' nature of the character, viewing it as a mark of Elstir's genius in capturing a specific moment.

Locate Internal: Steven suspects she does this to appear like a loyal friend and questions if kindness is actually absent from her nature (Item 5355). Analyze Interaction: Incongruity & Irony; the external kindness is reinterpreted as internal vanity. Synthesis: While Andrée performs an externally kind act of sacrifice, Steven's internal monologue reframes it as a calculated move to feed her own self-image of nobility; he disconnects the action from genuine altruism, viewing it instead as a performance of friendship rather than the reality of it.",

Analyze Interaction: Metaphorical Mapping; somatic discomfort maps to psychological resistance to change. Synthesis: Steven's physical relocation is processed internally through a visceral metaphor of ingestion and distortion (the python); this image conveys his psychological inability to 'digest' or assimilate the new environment, expressing his extreme discomfort and feeling of foreignness in the new space.",

Analyze Interaction: Explanation & Drive; the mundane is elevated to the mythical to preserve the ideal. Synthesis: Steven resolves the cognitive dissonance of seeing a 'goddess' perform mundane physical tasks by reframing her actions as a deliberate 'performance' or a mythological transformation (like Zeus as a swan); this internal narrative protects his idealized image of her nobility from being degraded by ordinary reality.",

Locate Internal: He feels that the significance of the event has vanished in the moment, and he has forgotten his original purpose (Item 4734, 4741). Analyze Interaction: Incongruity & Irony; the trivial physical act dominates the supposedly momentous social event. Synthesis: Steven's action of eating a tart—a trivial pleasure—dominates the moment because his internal processing of the event has stripped it of its anticipated significance; the 'event' of meeting his crush becomes internally flattened, leading to a behavioral incongruity where he prioritizes a pastry over the person he longed to meet.",

Analyze Interaction: Explanation & Drive; the contrast of the environment amplifies the sensory input. Synthesis: Steven's perception of the faint singing as a clear 'orchestral theme' is rationalized by his internal appreciation of the new neighborhood's silence; his mind magnifies the solitary auditory input because it is isolated against a quiet background, transforming a mundane street sound into a significant aesthetic experience.",
