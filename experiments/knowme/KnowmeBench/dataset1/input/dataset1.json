From the first sentence, I sank deeply into the story, deeper and deeper. The protagonist was named Ged, who lived on an island and possessed a special gift. People discovered his talent and sent him to a school for wizards. There, his extraordinary abilities flourished. Once, driven by overwhelming pride, he performed a feat that opened a gate to another world—the underworld, the land of the dead—and released a shadow. Ged nearly died, weakened and scarred by the experience, and the shadow pursued him relentlessly. He managed to escape, hiding where people of the world could not see him, abandoning all ideals and ambitions because he believed he could only perform the most basic magic—empty gestures and hollow tricks. Yet another kind of magic existed, deeper and interwoven with all things in the world. The wizard’s greatest task was to maintain the balance among all things. Every object had its true name, and that name reflected its essence. Only by knowing the true names of all things could one master and control them. Ged could do this, though he didn’t know it himself. For every spell, every use of magic, disturbed the original balance, causing unforeseen consequences elsewhere. The villagers thought him a poor wizard because he refused even the simplest tricks, unlike the village sorcerers who earned their living from such acts. He was young, solemn, bore a large scar across his face, and was especially sensitive to cold. But when something truly mattered, when he truly had to use his gift, he would not hesitate. Once, when a child lay near death, he followed the child into the land of the dead and brought him back—though he shouldn’t have. It was extremely dangerous, for certain balances must never be broken, and the balance between life and death was one of them. Yet he did it, and during the process, he himself came close to dying. That was the first time the villagers understood who he really was. And the shadow that had slipped out from the land of the dead kept chasing him, watching him, drifting across the world. Whenever he used his power, the shadow would sense it and draw nearer. He had to flee. So he did—he boarded a ship, intending to cross the ocean to the farthest shore from the island. The shadow drew closer and closer. After several confrontations, Ged stood on the brink of death, facing a final showdown. He had long tried to discover the shadow’s name—searching ancient records of the oldest beings, questioning wiser wizards—but found nothing. He faced an unknown creature, one without a name. But then, suddenly, he understood. At sea, alone in his boat, as the shadow approached, he realized it. The shadow was called Ged. The shadow bore his name. The shadow was himself."

In spring and summer, life generally took place outdoors, and the connection between children's lives and adults' lives operated on a different scale. But when autumn arrived and darkness fell earlier and earlier, that connection seemed to be severed. As soon as the door closed behind us at home, we could slip into a world entirely our own. These short, dark, cold evenings were filled to the brim with unseen and hidden excitement and emotion. And there was also the joy inside the rooms. Although I couldn’t bring my friends home—no child from the housing estate had ever entered my room—I could go to their rooms. Some houses I visited only occasionally, others frequently.

During this time, you might find such a magazine in a ditch, on the grass, or under a bridge.

We just wanted to stand there flipping through the pages, we could stand there forever, beneath the heavy, dense branches of pine trees, staring at these photos. The women seemed to have just risen from the marsh, straightened up on the yellowing autumn grass—they felt closely connected to both.

No, what I loved was everything else: from the moment we boarded the bus, traveling through darkness, walking the path into Aucity, passing through the empty nighttime city, pausing at the same shops along the way. I loved entering the swimming hall itself, that large public building which blended the outside and inside so perfectly. It felt as if we passed through a funnel: standing in the outer corridor bundled tightly in winter clothes, then fifteen minutes later standing nearly naked, having completed the ritual of undressing, showering, putting on swimsuits and caps. Now we stood at the edge of the pool, clad only in small swim trunks, ready to leap into that strange, transparent coolness tinged with chlorine. That was what I truly loved. Then the whole process reversed: we transformed from pale-skinned, bony boys with big heads and almost bare bodies back into fully dressed boys stepping outside, wet hair hidden under hats, skin still faintly smelling of chlorine, limbs limp yet deeply content."

An inner voice urged me to fight for victory, and I would argue with it.

He was faster because his belief in winning was stronger. And then there was his drawing—it was his specialty, a natural talent always present within him. Aside from people, he could depict everything else with precise accuracy and vivid realism: houses, cars, ships, trees, tanks, airplanes, rockets. He never copied things like I did, and his mother never allowed him to use rulers or erasers.

The candy shelf that both of us now stared at occupied the opposite wall. Unlike the tobacco products, these candies had no packaging; chocolates, hard candies, and gummy sweets were displayed in transparent plastic containers, showing themselves openly. There were no pictures between us and them: what we saw was exactly what we would get.",

The small square chocolates were called \"recruits\"—they had a hard chocolate shell surrounding firm caramel, matching their shape. Heart-shaped chocolates contained soft, jelly-like fillings that tasted of apricot, just as expected. With few exceptions, we tried to figure out the correspondence between colors and flavors of the candies and gummies. Some black candies tasted like dark green ones, while some dark green candies tasted like green lozenges or eucalyptus oil—not the kind of flavor one would expect from green candy when seeing its color. Their taste was milder. Some black candies tasted like the anise-flavored \"King Baywick\" candies, the orange-marmalade-colored kind. Strangest of all, they never worked the other way around: the orange-marmalade-colored \"King Baywick\" candies never tasted like black candies, nor had we ever encountered eucalyptus-green candies that tasted like green or black ones."

I also wanted shin guards, a Puma bag, Atomic Atom alpine skis and slalom ski boots for winter, an alpine ski pants, and a real down jacket. Splitkein fiberglass skis with new bindings. Light-colored Sami boots, the kind with slightly upturned toes. A new white shirt, a red sweater. I’d rather have white rubber boots instead of the dark blue ones I was wearing now. I also wanted a pale red coral necklace I once saw, or white would do too. I wasn’t very interested in boats, motorcycles, or cars.

These brands all started with unusual letters: Y, Z, W. For the same reason, I was also drawn to 'Wolverhampton,' my first supported team, even though Liverpool later replaced it.

But he did—he launched into a furious tirade at the referee and even slammed his racket hard onto the ground, sending it flying several meters away. I could hardly bear such scenes. I loved him so much that every time he lost a match, I cried and couldn’t stay indoors—I had to go outside, onto the road, where I sat by the roadside, weeping bitterly over the loss. It was the same with Liverpool. If they lost the Football Cup final, I’d go outside, tears streaming down my face. My favorite player in that team was Emlyn Hughes—he was my man. Of course, I liked a few others too, especially Ray Clemence and Kevin Keegan, but only before Keegan moved to Hamburg and Newcastle. It was a very specific comparison—they were similar in many ways, yet each had their own personal style and shortcomings. The comparison was roughly fair.

Monica was intellectually sharp and well-read; when we discussed the conflict in Palestine, she always restrained herself, speaking moderately yet firmly in defense of Israel—something I couldn’t quite grasp, since clearly Israel was a military state and Palestine the victim. It was pleasant just to be in the same room as Elsa Ingrid. Early in the semester, Siv remarked that the area between the church school and the business school resembled an American campus, and that’s when I first noticed her—because she knew something I didn’t, and I wanted to belong to this world. Siv loved boasting, and her laugh was unusually loud. Tone seemed more independent than the others. At a class gathering that autumn, I fondled and kissed Anne on the barber chair belonging to Baasen’s mother. Hilde still sometimes hesitated, often turning toward me."

Perhaps it was because of our lifestyle—just the two of us living together—but clearly, it wasn’t only that. He’d never had any friends, nor did anyone ever visit us except family.

In the end, we came up with a solution: Vallund would go home saying my mother drove us, while I would say it was Vallund’s father. It was a bit risky, since our parents might meet later and expose the lie, but we decided to take the chance anyway. Once we’d agreed on that, the next issue was how to travel. On New Year’s Eve, the buses here stopped running, but we found a workaround—we could head to the Timenes crossroads, about ten kilometers from here. We’d hitchhike there—if we were lucky, catch one ride all the way; if not, transfer to a bus from there. To avoid questions or suspicion, it was best to wait until the guests arrived before making our move. That meant seven o’clock. The bus left at eight ten—that had to be the plan.

On nights like this, parents probably don't expect us to stay completely sober anyway."

It was utterly exhilarating. That exhilaration never tired, it stayed alive inside me all day long, and it’s alive in me now. I am eternal.

In other words, I favor depth over surface, praise beauty over evil, support the weak against the strong. So logically, shouldn’t I be happy that my father has moved toward the softer side? No—this is only the appearance of softness.

No, it must express innovation rooted in tradition; deep feeling combined with nimble liveliness; sharp intelligence paired with simplicity and sincerity, free of pretense. Real music isn’t for everyone, isn’t the best-selling, yet it still captures an era—my era, my experiences and journey. Ah, a brand-new age. I stand on the side of the new age. This is far removed from my father’s embroidered shirt and Sami boots. On the other hand, it’s understandable—he belongs to a different generation. Imagining people from his time starting to dress like Ian McCulloch, listening to underground American bands like Husker Dü, obsessing over events on U.S. television, following debut albums by R.E.M. or Green on Red, or mixing cowboy fringes into their wardrobes—this feels almost like a nightmare. The point is, the embroidered shirt and Sami boots were never truly him.

So by the time I turned sixteen and started becoming interested in who people 'were,' that chapter of his life was merely a hazy backdrop within my impression of him. Far more significant was the fact that he wrote poetry. Not because I particularly liked poetry, but because the poems 'revealed' much more about him. You don’t write poetry unless you have to—that is, unless you are a poet. He didn’t talk to us about writing, but neither did he hide it. We knew, somehow. One year some of his poems were published in Tid og Sted, and another year Class Struggle published a few—poems about the everyday lives of industrial workers, small and simple impressions. Though they occupied little space, they earned him recognition among the book-loving Hartlev family. When one of his poems appeared on the back cover of the literary magazine Vinduet, accompanied by a small portrait of him, and then, years later, his poems filled two full pages in the same magazine, he had become, in our eyes, a poet in his prime.",

Grandma was ill, sitting trembling at the table. Her hands shook, and so did her arms, head, and feet. She would occasionally convulse, at which point she had to be laid on a chair, her legs bent forcefully, then massaged. Yet her mind was clear, her eyes alert—she could see us, and was happy to do so. Grandpa was short and round, lively and humorous, always ready with a story, often laughing so hard at his own tales that tears streamed down his face. But such moments were rare, because Kjertan was there—he had spent an entire year immersed in Heidegger, his mind filled with Heidegger, trapped in endless, meaningless labor, with no one to share it with, since within several kilometers no one had ever heard of Heidegger, nor wanted to listen—even though I suspect he tried—surely he must have—but to no avail. No one understood. No one wanted to understand. He could only find joy in it alone.",

I was seventeen then, in upper secondary school. Though I didn’t understand a single line of his poetry, he knew I was a reader. That was enough for him. The moment we walked in, he opened up, pouring out the accumulated thoughts of an entire year. It didn’t matter that we didn’t understand. It didn’t matter that it was Christmas Eve.

From then on, whenever I thought of the supreme, I would think of Hölderlin; and whenever I thought of Hölderlin, I would see high mountains and fjords, night and rain, sky and earth—and my uncle’s shining eyes."

He recovered, stood up again, spent a few weeks in a clinic for alcohol addiction treatment, and then returned to being as he was before. During that time, I didn’t contact him. But he started visiting Grandma more and more frequently, staying longer each time. Eventually he moved in and shut himself away. He gathered everything he still had and stored it in the garage.

So he lay there, surrounded by plates with leftover food, beer bottles, wine glasses, and the liquor she brought him from his large stockpile. How long he lay there, Marivik didn’t know—perhaps a day, perhaps two. He called Henrik Inge to tell him, realizing things couldn’t go on like this.

First, the things on the floor: used-up dry soap, greasy shampoo bottles, cardboard toilet paper rolls, a grimy bath brush with brown stains, aluminum foil and plastic pill packaging, some loose pills, a few socks, and several curlers. After clearing these, I started emptying everything from the wall cabinet, except for two small bottles of what looked like expensive perfume. Razor blades, razors, hairpins, more soap, old dried-up moisturizers and ointments, a hairnet, aftershave, deodorant, eyeliner, lipstick, a few cracked powder puffs whose purpose I didn’t know—probably makeup-related—hairs, some short and curly, others long and straight, a nail clipper, a roll of plastic, dental floss, combs. Once I’d emptied everything, a thick layer of yellowish-brown grime remained on the shelves. I decided to clean that last. The tiles beside the toilet, where the toilet paper roll hung, were covered in brown stains, and the floor beneath was sticky. This was my top priority. I sprayed Jif cleaner onto the tiles and began scrubbing methodically, systematically—from the ceiling down to the floor, first the right wall, then the wall next to the mirror, then along the bathtub, finally the wall by the door. I cleaned every single tile thoroughly. This entire process took an hour and a half.",

I had to gather all my willpower just to overcome this fear and enter the bathroom. I knew there was nothing inside, I knew the rustling was just water, the coats were just coats, the shoes were just shoes, the stairs were just stairs—but perhaps precisely because I knew this so clearly, my fear intensified. I simply did not want to be alone with these things. That was why I was afraid—these lifeless, inanimate objects stirred deeper fear in my heart. I would continue to experience the world through this attitude. The toilet lid seemed alive, so did the sink, the bathtub, and this black garbage bag standing greedily on the floor. And yet tonight, that discomfort returned, because Grandfather had fallen here, because Father died yesterday in the living room upstairs—so now the dead objects became entangled with the dead themselves, my father and grandfather. How could I possibly untangle this feeling? Well, only through cleaning. Scrub after scrub, wipe after wipe. Watching each tile become clean and shiny. Imagining how everything ruined here would regain its luster, all of it, every single thing. Under no circumstances would I end where he ended."

I might hurl the cup in my hand at him, or a slice of bread if that’s what I was holding, or an orange; if I didn’t rush at him and punch wildly, I’d just stand trembling with tears welling up. Then he would soften, take it all back, grip my hand tightly, and say, 'There, there, little one, now you're angry, poor little thing...' He also knew every single thing I feared. So when Mom was on night shift and Dad was at the municipal council meeting, and the TV was rebroadcasting *The Intruder*, a series deliberately aired late at night so kids our age wouldn’t watch it, it was the easiest thing in the world for him: turn off all the lights in the house, lock the front door, turn to me and say, 'I’m not Henrik Inge—I’m an intruder.' I would immediately scream in terror, begging him to say he was Henrik Inge: 'Say it, say it—you are Henrik Inge, I know you are, Henrik Inge, Henrik Inge, you’re not some intruder, you’re Henrik Inge...' He also knew another fear of mine—the sound from the pipes when turning on the hot water tap: first a sharp, screeching noise, then heavy thudding knocks. To me, the only possible response was to flee. So we made a pact: every morning after he washed his face at the sink, he wouldn’t drain the water—he’d leave it for me.

I had never smoked before, but I’d long planned to do so one day... So there I stood beneath the green spire of St. Helen Ster Church, the city market square stretching before me, crowded with people and vehicles, glass surfaces glinting in the sun.

After the Wall of Voodoo concert, we sat at Stovik and decided that when I came here, we’d start a band: Henrik Inge’s friend Bård could play bass, Henrik Inge would play guitar, and I’d be drummer. We’d find a lead singer later. Henrik Inge could compose, I’d write lyrics. That night we promised each other: one day, we’ll perform right here at Stovik. It wasn’t just the places—cafés, shops, parks, reading rooms, auditoriums—but also all his friends. When I met them, they not only knew who I was, but also what I was doing: I had my own music program on the local radio, promoted records and concerts in the local paper *Hjemmefolk*. After meeting them, Henrik Inge always told me what they’d said about me—often compliments from girls, calling me handsome or stylish. But boys talked too, especially Arvid, who once remarked I resembled the boy in Visconti’s *Death in Venice*. In their eyes, I was someone—and I owed it all to Henrik Inge. He took me to Vinjer Hut, where he and his friends gathered every New Year’s Eve. One summer I sold tapes on the streets of Aucity and made good money. We went out almost every night. One evening, I remember, I drank five beers in a row without losing control—Henrik Inge was both amazed and proud. By summer’s end, I was dating Henrik Inge’s girlfriend’s younger sister.",
    "inner_thought": "To me then, stepping into Baysang was stepping into my future. Leaving my current life behind, living in the future for a few days, then returning. In Vesfjord I was alone, fighting every battle by myself. In Baysang, I was with Henrik Inge—what he had, he shared with me."

They received the photos, but copies also ended up in the photographer’s display window in the lobby of the Vesfjord cinema, where everyone could see our 1980s outfits and hairstyles, awkwardly staged. Henrik Inge wore a light-blue shirt, a leather cord around one wrist, hair reaching his neck with the top cut short. I wore a black-and-white striped shirt, sleeves of my black suit rolled up, my studded belt and black trousers, hair down to my neck—longer than Henrik Inge’s, with the top even shorter. I also had a dangling cross earring swinging from one ear. During that time, I often went to the cinema, usually with Vallund or other friends from Tvet... This means my life in Vesfjord had certain visible, outward characteristics, tied to fixed spaces—school, stadium, city center—and to specific groups: friends, classmates, teammates. But the person in those photos was connected in a completely different way—to intimate, hidden ties, primarily within the family, which I had once been part of, though I had since distanced myself. Henrik Inge spoke of me to his friends, but I never mentioned him to mine.",

Henrik Inge worked weekends and holidays as a receptionist at Hotel Olean, and when I walked up to the front desk, he was in a great mood. He still had half an hour of work left, and afterward we bought shrimp and beer to celebrate my new beginning. We sat on the steps outside his dorm, drinking, while music from the Undertones poured loudly from the speakers in the living room. By evening, we were slightly tipsy, called a taxi, and drove down to visit Ulla, a friend of Henrik Inge’s. We had a few more drinks there, then went to Opera Café, staying until closing, with people constantly stopping by our table. 'This is my brother, Grete Lundnes,' Henrik Inge introduced me each time. 'He’s moved to Baysang and just started at the creative writing program. He’s going to be a writer.' Henrik Inge found me a student dorm in Sandviken, outside town—the original tenant was going to South America for a year. Until the room opened up, I stayed with Henrik Inge, sleeping on his sofa. He criticized me for small things, just as he’d done many times before whenever we lived together for more than a few days—ever since his Alek days. He scolded me for spreading brown goat cheese too thickly, or not putting records back properly. The same petty corrections happened again: I didn’t dry the bathroom floor after showering, I dropped butter on the floor while eating, I lowered the needle carelessly when playing records. Then one day I’d had enough. Standing by his car, he told me how I’d slammed the door too hard the last time I got in. I exploded, shouting angrily at him not to boss me around. He stopped. After that, he never corrected me again. But the balance in our relationship remained unchanged: I had entered his world, where I was the younger brother. College life was complicated—I didn’t make many friends, partly because everyone was older than me, partly because I found no common ground with them. So most of the time I drifted toward Henrik Inge, calling him to ask what he was doing that weekend. He always had plans and invited me along. Of course I came. After spending a Sunday wandering the city alone or lying in bed reading at the dorm, I desperately wanted to go see him in the evening.",
    "inner_thought": "I found a new friend: that wonderful feeling surrounding me in the spring of 1989. Though I told myself I shouldn’t, that I should solve my problems independently, the temptation was too strong—I kept sinking into the sofa in front of his TV."

Going alone to visit one of his friends? That would seem strange, almost too desperate, and it wouldn’t work.

Our band, Kafka Makers, played gigs in Stovik, performed at 'The Garage,' some of our songs were broadcast on the radio, and we received good reviews in music magazines—it was decent, but I knew well enough that the only reason I was included was because I was Henrik Inge’s younger brother, since I was actually a terrible drummer. When I turned twenty-four, it suddenly hit me: this was truly my life, laid out precisely as it was, perhaps always had been. Student years—the most confusing and frequently romanticized period of life—would later be fondly remembered by others, but for me they left nothing but a string of bleak, lonely, imperfect days. Before achieving the goal of entering university, I had carried full hopes inside, all those ridiculous dreams typical of twenty-year-olds: about women and love, friends and joy, some secret talent within me suddenly breaking through. But when I turned twenty-four, I saw its true face. Well then, fine, so be it. I did have small joys of my own, but no, I could endure the loneliness and decline it brought. I am bottomless—bring it on, these days, I can think, I can accept... Just come! Pour your piss over me! If you want, shit on me too! I’ll take it all! I can endure! I’m a ninja myself! The girls I longed for must have seen exactly this in my eyes: ambition, faint hope—I’ve never doubted that.

Olaf Ingva was the type who read Beckett in high school, listened to jazz, played chess, wore long hair, and had a certain tense, restless demeanor. He was very introverted—he’d go silent if more than three people gathered in a tent—but his intelligence was obvious.

I skimmed a bit of Adorno, read a few pages of Benjamin, bent over Blanchot for several days, glanced at Derrida and Foucault, studied Kristeva, Lacan, Deleuze briefly, and in poetry, Ekelöf, Björlin, Pound, Mallarmé, Rilke, Trakl, Ashbery, Mandelstam, Lundén, Thomson, Haug—all superficially browsed, never spending more than a few minutes on any one, reading them like prose, like a MacLean or Bagley novel, learning nothing, understanding nothing...",

Amid those heavy, complex, convoluted, extremely precise sentences, striving for constant mental ascent, where each period feels like a climber’s carabiner, something else exists too—a unique understanding of the atmosphere of reality. Under the influence of these sentences, vague desires awaken in me—to use this distinctive linguistic atmosphere to express something real, alive.

Henrik Inge himself had a reputation for puns and low humor, and his academic training led him to believe a work’s value lay not in the work itself, but in the social recognition it generated—regarding form, authentic and inauthentic expressions carried equal weight.

Haug is a permanent resident of the planet of wisdom, holding fast to himself, unmoved by anything, while I am a wanderer from that world, carrying known questions and gathering every phenomenon approaching me into my pack. It was my emotion, my crude, almost hostile attitude, that shaped my judgment of Haug—perhaps he felt something similar toward us. But finally he said, 'Well, come in then,' and tiptoed ahead of us into the living room, where we set down our backpacks and camera bags.

This was clearly a choice between two topics. But he didn’t want to talk about that either. Instead, he began speaking about a journey he’d made there long ago, mentioning names that sounded like they were from the 1960s. He stared at the floor, stating each name with certainty, as if we all knew them. We’d never heard of any of these people. All of it seemed meaningless, mysterious only in its personal significance.

The trees halfway up the mountainsides were yellow and red, the fjord’s surface like a mirror, broad white waterfalls cascading down. He was an old man, dressed like one—flannel shirt, old-man pants, slippers, and a hat, with an elderly gait.

You could never imagine such a thing from my grandfather or Alf… Or maybe not—he wasn’t really opening himself at all, but rather revealing his true nature, like his behavior when we first arrived, which was self-protection. I saw something I didn’t want to see, because the man didn’t realize what he was exposing to us. Living like this must actually be too painful, I think now. It only unsettles me inside."

Some inaccuracies in the manuscript, yes, as he pointed out, but I knew certain things he had indeed said—because I’d taken notes during the phone interview.

If he wished, I’d be happy to base a revision on his feedback, perhaps conduct another phone interview, and send him a new draft?

Meanwhile, I began volunteering at the school radio station, gradually entering a world different from his—especially after meeting Tonje. I fell madly in love with her, and that winter we got together. Before I even realized it, my life had taken a fundamental new turn. In the early years of my development in Baysang, I remained stuck in this pattern until suddenly Henrik Inge left the city, taking a job as a cultural advisor in Barrestrand. It wasn’t necessarily what he had hoped for, but there were no other staff in his department, so in practice he became its head. He organized the local jazz festival himself. Later, his friend Arvid moved there too, and he hired him into the department.

He once threw the blanket straight out the window—inexplicably—and spent the rest of the night shivering beneath the covers. Dad also sleepwalked. Sometimes in the middle of the night he’d appear in my room, wearing only underwear, perhaps opening a cabinet and peering inside, or staring at me with blank, unfocused eyes. Sometimes I’d hear him rummaging through the living room, moving furniture around. Once he slept under the living room table and, upon waking, smashed his head against it, bleeding profusely.

That summer, while selling tapes on Aucity Street, I stayed in Henrik Inge’s student dorm. I took his pencil case, walked naked onto the lawn outside, and stood peering into every window until Henrik Inge managed to find me. I was sleepwalking, yet I denied it—proof being the pencil case, I insisted: \"Look, this is my wallet. I’m just going out to buy something.\" Countless times I stood there watching the ground sink and vanish or swell upward, walls collapse or water rise. Once I stood bracing both hands against the wall, shouting for Tonje to run out before the house collapsed. Another time I became convinced she was locked inside a closet, so I threw all the clothes out trying to free her. When spending the night with someone other than Tonje, I usually warned them in advance about what might happen. Two years ago, with my partner Lenavik, we rented a large farm near Vesfjord to write a film script, calling it our writers’ retreat. We shared a room by arrangement. Around midnight, I got up from bed, walked over to him, pulled back his blanket, grabbed his elbow, and told him, \"You’re just a puppet,\" leaving him utterly terrified. But the scene that recurred most frequently was a otter or fox crawling into my bed, which I would then hurl to the floor and stomp on until I was certain it was dead. There might be a year when nothing happened at night, but then suddenly another period would begin when I roamed up and down every single night.",

During other periods, everything flowed smoothly, effortlessly, without any doubt or confusion. Now, only this latter image remained visible. My own confidence had certainly been affected by Dad too, but perhaps in a different way. At least I’d never experienced alternating phases of doubt followed by faith. For me, both were always present simultaneously—the doubt, largely shaped by my mental state, never directed toward grand ambitions, but always focused on the small things, the immediate surroundings, friends, acquaintances, girls. I constantly saw myself as inferior, regarded myself as foolish, yet inwardly carried something burning, burning every day.

Didn’t they trick Henrik Inge into believing that 'exhaust pipe' and 'carburetor' were the worst swear words, making him swear never to utter them?

Take, for example, the story from the early 1930s about her working as a private driver in Bergen—a tale we all knew well, part of our family mythology, since few women held driving licenses then, let alone worked as drivers. She responded to an ad in the newspaper, she said, reading the *Evening Post* at home in Østfold, wrote a letter, got the job, and moved to Bergen. She worked for a wealthy, eccentric old lady. The young grandmother, just over twenty, lived in a room inside the grand mansion and drove the woman wherever she wished. The old lady had a dog that often stuck its head out the window barking wildly at passersby—here grandmother always laughed, remembering how embarrassed she felt. And to illustrate just how peculiar the old lady really was—perhaps already suffering from dementia—grandmother always mentioned one particular observation: she noticed money hidden everywhere in the house. Stacks of cash beneath the refrigerator, inside pots and teapots, under carpets, under pillows in the bedroom. When grandmother reached this point in the story, she usually burst out laughing and shook her head, because we must remember she had just left home, coming from a small town, encountering not just the outside world, but an astonishingly strange one at that.",

The two brothers had studied together in Bærum—Alf in natural sciences, my grandfather in economics. After her relationship with Alf ended, Grandmother married my grandfather and moved to Vesfjord. Alf later moved there too, but by then he was married to Solveig. She had suffered from tuberculosis since childhood, one lung collapsed, and remained frail her entire life, unable to bear children. So when they were older, they adopted an Asian girl. Throughout my upbringing, most gatherings and celebrations were hosted by either Alf’s family or my grandparents’ family. They often visited us, and the history between Alf and Grandmother was frequently mentioned—it was no secret. After my grandfather and Solveig passed away, Grandmother and Alf met once a week; every Saturday morning, Grandmother would visit him at his villa in Grim. Nothing shocking about it, though some would smile knowingly—perhaps they really should have been together after all?",

When he got drunk, he always started this way: first mumbled speech, then increasingly nasal tones, until finally passing out completely and collapsing in an instant—something almost predictable. My own drunkenness was less obvious, mostly an internal shift. I usually remained articulate and precise in speech, which was problematic because people couldn’t tell how drunk I really was. Since I walked and spoke nearly as usual, there was never any excuse later for whatever reckless things I might have said or done. Instead, wildness and intensity grew stronger within me, unchecked by unconsciousness or social friction, continuing deeper into a state crystalline, empty, and primal. I loved it. I loved this feeling—it was the best I could feel. Yet it never brought me anything good. A day or days later, it would cling tightly to recklessness like stupidity, something I deeply despised inside myself. But when I was drunk, I couldn’t see the future or reflect on the past—I existed only in the present. That’s why I wanted to stay there, for my world to shine brilliantly amid the unbearable, torturous banality."

The dark, yellowish skin and the stiff expression made it look like a piece of wood carved from a tree. This tree-like face evoked no desire to come near.

How could there possibly have been blood? Grandmother had said she found him dead in the chair—apart from that, the most believable explanation was that he’d suffered a heart attack while sitting there, perhaps even while asleep. Yet the funeral home didn’t just mention blood—they said there was a lot of blood. And the nose—his nasal bone was broken. So was his death at the scene something different in nature? Did he stand up, in agony, and crash into the brick fireplace? Fall onto the floor? But if so, why were there no traces of blood on the walls or floor? Why hadn’t grandmother mentioned any blood? Something must have happened—not just blood—that made it impossible for him to simply pass away quietly. Did she wipe away the blood and then forget all about it? Why would she do that? She didn’t wipe anything away or hide anything—I saw no sign that she felt the need to. Equally strange is how quickly I myself forgot about it. Ah, but maybe that isn’t so strange—there are many other things to deal with now. Still, once I returned to grandmother’s house, I’d have to call Henrik Inge immediately. We needed to contact the doctor responsible for transferring his body to the hospital. He might tell us exactly what had happened."

    "inner_thought": "At the same time, another thought seemed to brew in my mind—the desire to prolong my time alone as much as possible, even considering stopping at a café to read a newspaper or something else. Being with Henrik Inge and staying with grandmother was one thing, but facing grandmother alone was quite another. Henrik Inge knew how to handle her. Their easy, humorous tone, similar to the approach used by Erling and Marivik, was—putting it mildly—a method I had never employed. During that year of gymnastics training, because I lived nearby, I spent a lot of time with them. It felt as though my attitude and behavior caused some unpleasantness, that I brought along ways they didn’t want, a suspicion later confirmed in some way months afterward when Mom told me grandmother had called saying I shouldn’t visit them so often. I could handle most accusations, but this one I couldn’t accept. Even if they didn’t welcome me, they were still my grandparents, and I was so shocked that I couldn’t hold back—I began sobbing right in front of Mom. From her perspective, she was also very upset, but what could she do? At the time, I couldn’t understand these things, thinking only that they simply didn’t like me. From then on, I began wondering what aspects of me might have made me unlikable. I couldn’t picture it, couldn’t step into their shoes. I carried my teenage habits into that house and stubbornly held on to them, assuming they’d eventually adapt. This created imbalance, since their habit was never to force me into anything, so ultimately they called my mother. My visits were always driven by need—either concrete, like going there to eat, since I arrived after school and before training, meaning I wouldn’t eat until eight or nine at night, or money-related, since only afternoon buses were free for students, and I couldn’t always afford tickets. Food and money—they didn’t object to providing these, but what angered them was probably my sense of entitlement. So they had no choice: meals and bus fare ceased being free gifts. But there were other factors too—the second reason was the issue of our relationship itself. They no longer wanted to maintain any connection between us. Back then I didn’t understand this. Now I do. My behavior there was to fully approach them with my entire life and thoughts—it was part of the same pattern. They couldn’t, perhaps wouldn’t, reciprocate that closeness, and I accepted some of it anyway. Ironically, during all those visits, I constantly thought of them, always saying what I believed they’d want to hear—even deeply personal, private matters, which I shared not because I needed to speak them, but because I thought it would benefit them to hear."

It is like a burst water pipe, a branch snapping in the wind, a garment slipping from a hanger and falling to the ground. Nothing more."

Arve went in and asked if they knew where the writers from Haldvik usually drank. They laughed at him and answered in English. So we wandered around aimlessly for a while, which was really awful, because I thought Arve was incredible—he was an intellectual, had been with 'The Wanderer' from the beginning. When we met at the airport, I couldn't utter a single word. Almost mute. Landed at Arlanda, couldn't speak. Entered Haldvik, found accommodation, said nothing. Went out to eat, silent. Not a single word. I knew my only chance was to break through the sound barrier with alcohol. After finishing a beer on Queen Street, I asked where the fun places were; they said go to Söder, find the Golden Monkey, so we took a taxi here. I drank spirits, and my tongue nearly loosened up, occasionally managing to blurt out a sentence. Arve leaned close to my ear and whispered, 'That girl is looking at you—do you want me to step aside so you two can be alone?' I asked, 'Which girl?' Arve said, 'That one.' I looked at her—damn, she was hot! But most of that reaction came simply because Arve pointed her out. Isn't that a bit strange?\"",

He had an enormous capacity for acceptance. In any case, he listened to the entire story. How my father died, the hellish move, my debut book and everything that followed—I kept talking even after finishing that. I remember waiting for a taxi at the station, nobody else around—just me and Arve. He looked at me while I talked and talked. Childhood, adolescence—there wasn't a single thing I didn't mention. It was all about me, nothing else. Me, me, me. I poured out my entire inner world to him. Something in him opened me up, made me feel understood in everything I said and thought—someone I'd never encountered before. With others, there were always limits, attitudes, needs, causing words to retreat at crucial moments, or being steered in specific directions, always transforming what I said into something else, making it impossible to appear as I truly was. But that day, I felt Arve was genuinely open—curious, and constantly striving to understand what he saw. Yet his openness had no ulterior motive, not that damned psychologist's kind of openness. His curiosity was entirely free of self-interest. He possessed deep insight into human nature, hence great worldly wisdom, and like any seasoned person, he spent most of his time laughing uproariously. Indeed, when facing human behavior and beliefs, laughter is perhaps the most appropriate response.\"",

Then an angel intervenes and shows him what the world would be like without him. I don’t think you need an angel to understand how important you are to us—but sometimes perhaps we do. You give everyone space to be themselves. Now, that might sound commonplace, but it’s not—in fact, it’s a very rare quality. And sometimes it’s hard to recognize. It’s not hard to see someone boasting about themselves, or judging others by their own standards. But you never boast, you never impose your standards: you accept people as they are, adapt to them.

This applies to your life as well, and to how you relate to others: things take time. Everything requires the time it needs. When I was seven and starting school, I didn't know how to understand that. On the first day, you drove me there—I remember it clearly—and you weren't quite sure of the way, but you were confident we'd manage. We drove through one residential area, then another. I sat in the car in my light-blue uniform, with my little backpack and combed hair. While we circled aimlessly around Rocky, my new classmates stood on the schoolyard and listened to the entire welcome speech. By the time we finally arrived, it was all over. I could tell countless similar stories. For instance, you once drove for kilometers completely lost—no exaggeration—through unfamiliar terrain, unaware you'd long left the roads near Bærum. Eventually you stopped on a narrow path fit only for tractors, at the dark, dead end of some remote valley. There are so many such incidents. Just recently, one week ago, on your sixtieth birthday, you invited colleagues over for coffee. They arrived, but you'd forgotten to buy coffee, so you all ended up sitting down to tea instead. Sometimes I think this absent-minded side of your personality is actually a prerequisite for your presence—during our conversations, and in your talks with others.'",

I mused that perhaps men staying home for half a year to care for an infant might actually enhance their own vitality. I imagined women genuinely longing for those men at home—the ones with thin arms and big buttocks, shaved heads, wearing branded black-framed glasses—to gather together not only joyfully debating the pros and cons of Bear Brand baby carriers but equally excitedly discussing whether homemade baby food or store-bought organic fruit puree was better. I believed maybe they truly longed for exactly that, with full passion and complete engagement of body and soul.
