  },
  {
    "id": "41",
    "answer": "The most important thing is to maintain a superficial sense of propriety and normalcy, avoiding exposing family privacy or uncomfortable truths to the eyes of friends, relatives, and the community.

  },
  {
    "id": "42",
    "answer": "He couldn't determine it. His father had never expressed love in a way that he could understand or need.

  },
  {
    "id": "43",
    "answer": "Extreme anxiety that he might repeat his father's patterns—emotional, detached, and harmful—yet at the same time, he anticipates that by thoroughly understanding the past, he can consciously create a different father-son relationship.

  },
  {
    "id": "46",
    "answer": "This reveals the extreme duality of the father's personality—his desire for control and his sense of being out of control. The neatness of his early years was a forced external order against inner chaos; the dirtiness of his later years, on the other hand, is the result of inner chaos completely devouring the external order, a manifestation of giving up on struggle."
  },
  {
    "id": "47",
    "answer": "What he cares most about is preventing dailytrivial matters—such as childcare, housework, and socializing—from tearing his consciousness apart, thus causing him to lose control over the vast narrative threads. (He’s not afraid of being busy; rather, he fears that trivial tasks will disrupt his continuous, immersive state of thought. Once interrupted, rebuilding it would be a life-threatening ordeal.)"
  },
  {
    "id": "48",
    "answer": "Writing. But he’ll try to balance it by doubling down on his responsibilities afterward or enduring intense guilt—essentially a form of delayed repayment, where the priority of writing never changes.

  },
  {
    "id": "49",
    "answer": "Minimalism and functionalism. The \"I's\" spiritual world is rich, yet it lacks interest in material things, viewing them as burdens that need to be maintained. (\"The I feels that all objects are redundant. The I's world is supported by feelings and words; too many objects actually take up space and disturb the I from clearing out the ruins within.\" )"
  },
  {
    "id": "50",
    "answer": "In life, I endure chaos; in writing, I adhere to iron rules. I can tolerate the daily disorder of family life, yet I maintain an almost obsessive insistence on my daily writing progress and page count. (In life, \"I\" drift along with the tide and lack strong planning; but in writing, \"I\" have an iron discipline toward myself—no matter what, I write a fixed id of pages each day without fail.)"
  },
  {
    "id": "51",
    "answer": "The extreme fear of losing conscious control. The chaos brought on by alcohol deprives \"I\" of the ability to observe, analyze, and record—abilities that are fundamental to \"I's\" distinction from my father and my self-redemption. (\"I\" fears losing control. My father seeks escape in alcohol; \"I,\" in turn, seeks control in sobriety, fearing that getting drunk will cause me to lose this clear-headedness. The hazy, drunken world cannot be described precisely, yet description is the very evidence of his life.)"
  },
  {
    "id": "52",
    "answer": "First is the responsibility—avoiding becoming a “ghost father” who is merely absent; this responsibility also serves as an important source of writing material. Love is genuine yet complex, often intertwined with resentment; and the very act of “experiencing and documenting fatherhood” itself constitutes a powerful internal motivation."
  },
  {
    "id": "53",
    "answer": "There exists this underlying psychological mechanism. It’s not actively created, but when a crisis arises, the person is more inclined to delve deeper and let things unfold as they “can be written,” rather than trying to resolve them as quickly as possible. (This is plausible. When an argument or breakdown occurs, the thought—“this could become a great chapter”—flashes through one’s mind like a ghost, making the person less proactive in trying to calm the situation.)"
  },
  {
    "id": "54",
    "answer": "From internalization or eruption, shift toward \"textualization.\" (Post. But when anger rises, it quickly turns into an observation of one's own anger—anger becomes the object of his analysis, not merely an emotion for release.)"
  },
  {
    "id": "55",
    "answer": "From a place of need to flee, it becomes an observation site that is both being built and simultaneously dismantled. (The home is no longer a place where the father once lived, but has transformed into a scene that is constantly unfolding and being written.)"
  },
  {
    "id": "56",
    "answer": "Not a particular person, but rather the social image itself—of being a father and a husband."

  },
  {
    "id": "58",

    "answer": "Like the most rigorous critics of each other, they are constantly reading and judging each other's works and souls."
  },
  {
    "id": "60",
    "answer": "Freedom."
  },
  {
    "id": "61",
    "answer": "The mother-in-law in the text actually still loves her daughter and hopes she can achieve lasting happiness, so she is somewhat concerned about the tense and strained emotional state between her daughter and her son-in-law. This mother will continue to prioritize the needs of her children or husband above all else, while placing her own needs in a secondary position. By contrast, the author's own mother, on the other hand, remains completely indifferent to matters concerning her sons. Not only does she not interfere in the affairs of her adult sons who need help, she has never even considered offering a helping hand herself."
  },
  {
    "id": "62",
    "answer": "Evaluation of the mother-in-law: She, too, has experienced certain emotional repression, which is why she secretly drinks a bit of strong liquor at her son-in-law’s home while taking care of her grandson, seeking to relieve stress. Evaluation of the mother: She is truly an extraordinary and unique person. I really can’t find any beautiful words to describe her—thank you for not being able to express it."
